### What I learned

I learned that aligning separate CSS Grid containers often requires matching column structures to maintain vertical visual alignment across sections.

```css
  .top-section-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
  .numbered-articles-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
```
